# Panther Protocol Trusted Setup Ceremony

## Overview

This repository facilitates the trusted setup ceremony for a zero-knowledge circuit. Each participant contributes randomness to the process, ensuring no single entity possesses the complete "toxic waste" that could potentially compromise the system's security.

The ceremony is sequential - each participant builds upon the previous contribution. This approach ensures the security of the final parameters as long as at least one participant is honest.

## Time Commitment

- **Preparation time**: ~5-15 minutes to set up your environment
- **Contribution time**: ~5-10 minutes of uninterrupted time when it's your turn
- **Availability**: You should be responsive in the communication channel during your turn to avoid delays for other participants

## Prerequisites

Contributors have multiple options to participate in the Ceremony, each with different prerequisites:

- **Option A & B: Running Inside a Docker Container**  
  In this approach, [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) must be installed. This eliminates the need for locally installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), as the Docker container is pre-configured with everything required for the ceremony.  
  Running inside a container ensures the ceremony operates in an isolated environment, minimizing interference from the host system. It is the **recommended option** for most contributors.  
  Participants can choose between using a **pre-built Docker image** (Option A) or building the Docker image locally (Option B).

- **Option C: Running Without Docker (Directly on the Computer)**  
  In this method, contributors run the ceremony scripts directly on their computer without requiring [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). However, in this case, both [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) must be installed locally. This setup is less isolated than running inside a Docker container but can be used if Docker is unavailable.

### General Requirements:
Regardless of the chosen option, ensure you have:
- **Basic familiarity with command-line operations** to execute the required commands.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - For cloning and managing the repository.

### Dependencies Based on Your Chosen Option:
| **Option**             | **Required Tools**                                                                                  |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **A & B (Docker)**     | [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)                 |
| **C (Without Docker)** | [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download), [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) |

## Security Best Practices

For maximum security of the ceremony, we recommend:

- Use a freshly installed operating system
- Disconnect from the internet after downloading the necessary files
- Utilize a computer with a hardware random number generator
- Securely wipe or physically destroy storage media after participating

While following these recommendations provides maximum security, any contribution remains valuable even if all security measures cannot be implemented.

## Participation Guide

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<Your-GitHub-Username>/trusted-setup-ceremony.git
   cd trusted-setup-ceremony
   ```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

1. **Create the `.env` File**  
   Copy the provided `.env.example` file to create a new `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit the `.env` File**  
   Open the newly created `.env` file in your preferred text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, or a GUI-based editor) and customize the values, especially by filling in your AWS credentials. For example:
   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```

3. **Customize S3 Configuration**  
   Update the file with your AWS access details (e.g., `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, `S3BUCKET`).

4. **Default Configuration**  
   If you do not modify the S3 bucket information, the ceremony will use the default bucket `trusted-setup-files`, located in the `us-east-1` region.

## Troubleshooting

### Network Issues

If you encounter connectivity problems:

1. Verify your firewall settings allow the required connections
2. For NAT router users, enable UPnP or configure port forwarding
3. Try an alternative contribution method from Section 2

### Alternative File Sharing Methods

If standard contribution methods fail, consider:

1. Submitting a pull request with your contribution files
2. Sharing files via secure cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox)
3. Using [Magic-Wormhole](https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io/) for secure file transfer

## Verification Guide

This section provides detailed information about the verification process, including automatic file downloads, understanding results, and troubleshooting.

### Automatic File Downloads

When running verification, the following will happen automatically if files are missing:

- **PTAU File**: The Powers of Tau file (powersOfTau28_hez_final_17.ptau) will be downloaded from S3 if not found locally
- **Initial Setup**: If the initial setup folder (0000_initial) isn't present locally, it will be downloaded
- **Contribution Folders**:
  - If you have no contribution folders or only the initial setup folder, **all** contributions will be downloaded from S3
  - If you already have multiple contribution folders, the verification will use your existing local files
  - To force a fresh download of all contributions, delete the contributions folder first

### Understanding Verification Results

After the verification completes, a summary table will be displayed showing:

- A table with each circuit and contribution combination
- The status (PASS/FAIL) for each verified circuit
- Overall statistics showing total verifications, passed tests, and failed tests
- Details of any failed verifications for troubleshooting

Example output:
```
=== VERIFICATION SUMMARY ===

Contribution           | zAccountRegistration | zAccountRenewal    | zSwap             | zTransaction
---------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | -----------------
0001_pycckuu           | ✅ PASS             | ✅ PASS           | ✅ PASS           | ✅ PASS
0002_pycckuu           | ✅ PASS             | ✅ PASS           | ✅ PASS           | ✅ PASS
0003_pycckuu           | ✅ PASS             | ✅ PASS           | ✅ PASS           | ✅ PASS

=== OVERALL RESULTS ===
Total verification tests: 12
Passed: 12
Failed: 0
```

#### Troubleshooting Verification

If verification fails, check:

- Network connectivity to download required files
- S3 credentials if files can't be downloaded
- Free disk space for downloaded files
- Whether the initial zkey files match the contribution files being verified

## Technical Details

### Docker Image Information

The official ceremony Docker image is available on Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull pantherprotocol/trusted-setup-ceremony:latest
```
You can specify a version by replacing `:latest` with a version tag (e.g., `:0.1`).

### Docker Command Parameters Explained

- `-v $(pwd)/contributions:/app/contributions` - Mounts your local contributions directory to the container
- `-it` - Enables interactive mode required for entropy input
- `--rm` - Automatically removes the container after execution
- `--env-file .env` - Makes environment variables from the `.env` file available inside the container
- The image supports both AMD64 (x86_64) and ARM64 architectures

### Verification Technical Details

The verification process:
1. Uses snarkjs `zkvi` command to verify each contribution
2. Compares each contribution against the initial setup using the PTAU file
3. Requires approximately 8GB RAM for verification
4. Can take 5-15 minutes to complete depending on hardware

## Coordinator Instructions

If you are coordinating the ceremony:

1. Initialize the repository by copying the r1cs and zkey files to the `contributions/0000_initial` folder
2. Push this initial setup to the repository
3. Regular verification helps ensure the integrity of each contribution
4. Monitor the verification summary table for any failed verifications
